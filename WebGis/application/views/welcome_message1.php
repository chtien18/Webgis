  <div class="panel-body">
 The idea of establishing a formal network of universities within the Mekong region to address the issues of wetland education, research and training has occurred for a long time and has been informally discussed among individual academic staff from different universities in various occasions when their academic paths crossed.
Until 2000, more concrete discussions for the establishment of the network were carried out. Core participants of the network were identified.
The first executive meeting was held in Ho Chi Minh City, hosted by the University of Natural Sciences, Viet Nam National University - Ho Chi Minh City, during 13-15 November 2002 in order to formally create the network. Representatives of the Rectors and Presidents of potential member universities attended the meeting. The main objectives of the meeting were to gather opinions of participating universities about the establishment of the network; to discuss details of network operations such as kinds of trainings, trainee groups, curriculums, academic credit exchange, fund raising, curriculum and logistics of the first training session in 2003; and to draft a Memorandum of Understanding that will be endorsed by member universities of the network.
The second executive meeting was held in Nakhonpathom, Thailand, hosted by Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies, Mahidol University, at Salaya, attended by the representatives of the Rectors and Presidents of member universities, to exchange information and discuss about future cooperations.
On 22 May 2003, the Signing Ceremony of the Agreement on Academic Cooperation of the University Network for Wetland Ecology and Conservation Training in the Mekong Region was held and hosted by Mahidol University at Salaya, Thailand.
Agreement on Academic Cooperation between 8 member universities of the network was signed by the representatives of all member universities. The agreement enters into force and shall continue for a period of 5 years. Moreover, the agreement on academic cooperation at the Faculty level was signed by the deans and directors of involving faculties and institutes.
